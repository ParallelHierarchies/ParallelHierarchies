## Features
### Concepts from Parallel Sets
  * Distribution of values per dimension and co-occurence of values between dimensions
  * horizontal reordering of dimensions
  * vertical reordering of categories per dimension
  * adding/removing dimensions to/from the view
  * sorting categories per dimension by value or description

### Concepts from Icicle Plots
  * exploration of hierarchical dimensions
  * drill-down to lower hierarchy levels per dimension while maintaining context for related categories on higher levels.

### Additional features
  * co-occurence of values in hierarchical dimensions
  * minimization of intersections between flows by reordering catgories, either using a greedy approach or the barycentric method for partitioned graphs
  * seperate view for items filtered per dimension as well as globally
  * fisheye lense to increase readability of small categories
